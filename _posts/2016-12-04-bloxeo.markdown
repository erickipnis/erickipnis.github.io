description: Bloxeo is an open-source, brainstorming and team-collaboration web application. It utilizes a JSON API back-end written using the ExpressJS MVC framework, a MongoDB NoSQL database and a ReactJS front-end. My main responsibilities for the project included server tasks ranging from unit testing to writing services and data modeling, as well as some work on the front-end.
